# My GitHub Project

This is my project. I published it directly from Visual Studio Code. The majority of this code is from:

    Python Automation Cookbook by Jaime Buelta. 
    Algorithms by Aditya Bhargava.
    Learning Python by Mark Lutz.
    Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney

These projects are to help me understand the Python language. Other books I use are:

    Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart
    Python Cookbook by Beazley and Jones
    Python for Networking and Security by Jose Ortega

All of these projects are followed by the books and self taught.
