# My GitHub Project

This is my project. I published it directly from Visual Studio Code. The majority of python code is from:

    Algorithms by Aditya Bhargava.
    Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart
    Learning Python by Mark Lutz.
    Python Automation Cookbook by Jaime Buelta.     
    Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney
    Python Cookbook by Beazley and Jones
    Python for Networking and Security by Jose Ortega
    Python One-Liners by Christian Mayer

All of these projects are followed by the books and self taught. These projects are to help me understand the Python language.   
Many of the projects will be written in Jupyter notebooks.
